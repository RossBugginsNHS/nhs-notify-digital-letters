## Summary

The code within here is for generating json schemas for the source yaml schemas.

[src/cloudevents/domains/digital-letters/2025-10-draft](src/cloudevents/domains/digital-letters/2025-10-draft) is where the source for the schemas is located.

At build time they will be generated and outputted to the docs folder, ready for deployment to github pages.
